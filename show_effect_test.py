# DESCRIPTION
#   Got bored and started perusing the source files of the game Quake III Arena (developed by ID
#   Software in 1999) and noticed that a lot of the effect textures have multiple files with
#   incrementing numbers. This gave me the idea to see if I could take a set of these textures
#   and create a way of looping them. This will be no where near as nice as how I assume ID software
#   animated effects in game but I feel like it's a nice little thing to test;

# DISCLAIMER
#   All images included in this program were created solely by ID Software and are only included
#   for demonstration purposes.;

# Package(s)
#   - opencv-python (cv2) - computer vision?;

# References
#   - Loop image in same window

effect_type = 0

# 0 = wait for input, > 0 = change every specified ms
# I assumed that the refresh rate in game is 20fps for flame effect
# so through some quick n' probably wrong calculation I estimated that 53 is
# close enough to simulate 20 fps (53 is for frametime)
#   ^ this could be completely wrong but it looks about what I remember so :P
