# image_loop_test
Test program to display images in quick succession

Why I created this:
  - I was bored and started perusing the source files of the game: Quake III Arena (developed by ID
  Software in 1999). I noticed that a lot of the effect textures had multiple files with
  incrementing numbers. This gave me the idea to see if I could take a set of these textures
  and create a way of looping them. This will be no where near as nice as how I assume ID software
  utilized these effects in game but I feel like it's a nice little thing to test.
  
 NOTE:
  - All images included in this repository were created solely by ID Software and are only included
  for demonstration purposes.
